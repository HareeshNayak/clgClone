                <p>The MBA department was conceptualized in 2008, as the brainchild of Rev.President Padma Vibhushan Dr.D.Veerendra Heggade has ever since carved an applaudable history for itself. We are advancing the SDM tradition of excellence in Management Education through the highest quality programs in teaching, research and on-site industry executive training with the vision of developing competent professionals with human values. Our picturesque campus covered with lush green is set in a beautiful landscape with a spectacular view and a fantastic living environment that encourages interaction and camaraderie. We have distinguished faculty, with extensive industry and academic experience to lead the management graduates, along with renowned visiting faculty and guest speakers. The autonomous department has crafted a curriculum that enables students to mobilize their abilities and bring out the best in themselves. Our efforts have always been focused on chiseling students with care and caution, not just for the globally competitive world but for life. Our unique teaching and learning process with a proper blend of theory and practice crosses the boundaries of nations towards industry readiness. The department is a VTU recognized research center under the faculty of Management Studies, a total of 3 research supervisors guiding 7 research scholars.</p>
